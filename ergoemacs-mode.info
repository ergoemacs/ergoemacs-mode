***********************

Xah Lee, David Capello, and Matthew Fidler

ErgoEmacs keybindings improves GNU Emacs for people who did not grew up
with emacs. User interface is based on common modern software interface
familiar to most people today, such as using 【Ctrl+C】 key for
Copy,【Ctrl+Z】 for undo, 【Ctrl+O】 for Open file, and also bundles
many elisp packages that are not in GNU Emacs.

1.1 Standard Keyboard Shortcuts
===============================

Common keyboard shortcut are supported, so you don't have to change
your mindset when you switch in and out of emacs. The following are
supported standard keys in Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. (Mac uses Cmd
instead of Ctrl.)

Standard name    Key press       Emacs command name
Copy Cut Paste   Ctrl+c Ctrl+x   kill-ring-save
Undo Redo Redo   Ctrl+v Ctrl+z   kill-region yank undo
Open New File    Ctrl+Shift+z    redo redo
Open Close Save  Ctrl+y Ctrl+n   new-empty-buffer
Save As Print    Ctrl+o Ctrl+w   find-file
Select All Find  Ctrl+s          close-current-buffer
                 Ctrl+Shift+s    save-buffer write-file
                 Ctrl+p Ctrl+a   print-buffer
                 Ctrl+f          mark-whole-buffer
                                 search-forward

Standard shortcuts for cursor navigation are also supported. Example:
【Ctrl+Left】 ⇒ go to previous word, Home ⇒ beginning of line,
【⇧ Shift+Down】 ⇒ selecting text downward

1.2 Window/Tab Switching
========================

The following are new commands that lets you easily switch windows or buffers.

Standard name       Key                    Emacs command name
Next Window       【Alt+`】 【Alt+~】        switch-to-next-frame

===================================================================

The following are new commands that combine the functionality of
several similar commands into one. This way, you have one single
command with one single shortcut to remember. They do what you want
depending on context.

Name                      Key       Description
shrink-whitespaces       【Alt+w】  Takes out spaces/tabs around cursor
compact-uncompact-block  【Alt+q】  Hard Wraps or unwraps text u Change
toggle-letter-case       【Alt+/】  capitilzation (ALL, First,lower)

1.4.1 Background
----------------

Key chords (like 【Ctrl+x】) is the bane of keyboarding. There are 3
types of key shortcuts to invoke commands in software:

  1. Single key. Examples include: 【F1】, 【⇞ Page △】.

  2. Key chord: 【⇧ Shift+a】, 【Ctrl+c】, 【Ctrl+⇧ Shift+z】,
     【Alt+F4】.

  3. Key sequence of single keys or chords. For example on Microsoft
     Windows, 【F10 e c】 for copy, or 【Alt+Space c】 to close
     window.

of these, in terms of efficiency and hand health (Repetitive Strain
Injury), the single key is the best. Key sequence of single keys is
second best. Key chord is the worst.

Key chord is the most hard on hand health, but is also conceptually the
most convoluted.

I [Xah Lee] remember in around 1991, when i first learned about key
chord on the Macintosh Classic. I thought, it's strange. You have to
hold ⌘ Cmd first, then press the key c, then, release c, then,
release ⌘ Cmd. It must be in that specific order.

A more natural way is either key sequence, or real chords. That is,
pressing several keys together but you don't have to worry about which
to hold or release first. Stenograph machines are like that.

1.4.1.1 Whence Did Key Chord Came From?
.......................................

I suppose, when computer keyboard came, sans levels and gears, but
habit stuck, and this evolved into “modifier” keys, with Bucky bits.

Now, thinking about this, i think Microsoft must be a genius, when they
invented the key system on Windows, where Alt is used to invoke menu,
and all command can be called by a sequence of key strokes. This is
probably the best system given the PC keyboard. This system, lets you
invoke any command, yet has menu counter-part, so it's easy to see a
list of them and also grouped by category. (emacs's system of course is
much more extensive than that.)


File: ergoemacs-mode.info,  Node: What Should a Keyboard Nerd Do with Key Chords?,  Next: Principles on Efficient Use of Key Chords,  Prev: Whence Did Key Chord Came From?,  Up: Background

1.4.1.2 What Should a Keyboard Nerd Do with Key Chords?
.......................................................

BAN the them out of the universe.

But, there isn't enough keys on keyboard. You only have 12 function
keys, plus some others such as ↖ Home, ↓. But there are 10 times
more commands in software. What to do?

For majority of commands, you should use a key sequence of single keys,
instead. For example, 【F10 e c】. But Function keys are further away.
So, you could start with a easy key such as 【▤ Menu e c】, and
reassign most of your keys to key sequence. (you can make Caps Lock as
your start key, whichever key on YOUR keyboard is easy to press.)

There are 26 letters in alphabet, plus 10 digits, so you have 36 key
choices for the key. (ignore punctuation keys for the moment) If each
of your command has 2 keys in a key sequence (not counting the starting
key), then you have 36 × 36 = 1296 possible keys for commands. Quite
enough!

Still, some commands are not suitable for key sequence. For example,
moving cursor by word. You want to be able to hold down a key and have
the cursor keep moving. You can't do that with key sequences, because
you need to release the key and press again to invoke the command
again. Answer: use single key. Retort: But F keys are far away and
arrow keys are already used. Answer: key chord then.


File: ergoemacs-mode.info,  Node: Principles on Efficient Use of Key Chords,  Prev: What Should a Keyboard Nerd Do with Key Chords?,  Up: Background

1.4.1.3 Principles on Efficient Use of Key Chords
.................................................

Key chord should be used only for commands that need to be repeated
within a second (hold the key and let the command repeat). This
includes moving cursor, paging, switching tab/window.

Key chord should use no more than one modifier. This saves your hand.
So, key chord such as emacs interactive replace 【Alt+⇧ Shift+%】 or
Mac's redo 【⌘ Cmd+⇧ Shift+z】 should not be allowed.

more detail at Keyboard Shortcut Design: Repeatable vs Non-Repeatable
Commands and Keys

If you survey commands in a editor, such as emacs, vast majority of
commands are the non-repeating type. The repeating type are probably
less than 5% of commands. Using 【Ctrl+‹letter/digit›】 key give
you about 36 spots. Adding Alt, you have 72 spots. And that's more than
enough for repeating commands. In practice, i estimate a programer uses
less than 30 repeating commands per day on average. #### What About
Sticky Keys? I do not advocate the Sticky Keys feature for the
handicapped. It's not the same. Sticky Keys actually make things a
worse, because it's a hack over key chords. When you press a sequence
of keys, it has to guess whether you mean a sequence or chord (since
emacs supports both). The end result is that it's confusing to use,
imprecise, and slows you down.

1.4.2 Keyboard Shortcut Design
------------------------------

This section discuss one criterion on the design of keyboard shortcut
system: Repeatable vs Non-Repeatable Commands and Keys. This applicable
in designing keybinding for emacs, vi, 3D modeling app, or any app that
has hundreds commands that needs to map to keys. #### Repeatable and
Non-Repeatable Commands In my keyboarding research, there's a important
discovery. Commands can be classified into 2 types: 1. Repeatable
commands. Commands that make sense to be repeated within a second. i.e.
moving cursor by char, word, page. Page up/down. Delete by char, word.
Expand selection, prev/next tab. You can hold down a key or a key-chord
to repeat the command many times.

  2. Non-repeat commands. This is vast majority. i.e. starting
     find/replace, open file, close file, list buffers, call a shell
     command or start shell, describe-function, keyword expansion or
     completion, list-matching-lines, sort-lines, kill-buffer,
     switch-to-buffer, ...

* Menu:

* Repeatable and Non-Repeatable Keys::


File: ergoemacs-mode.info,  Node: Repeatable and Non-Repeatable Keys,  Up: Keyboard Shortcut Design

1.4.2.1 Repeatable and Non-Repeatable Keys
..........................................

The Repeatable Commands must have keys that can be held down. Here's
example of repeatable hotkeys: F8, t, ⇟ Page ▽, ↓, 【Ctrl+t】,
【Ctrl+Alt+8】, ....

Non-repeatable hotkeys are basically keys that involves a sequence:
【Ctrl+x 2】, 【F8 F9】

So, when designing a shortcut system, one of the principle is for
repeatable commands be on repeatable keys, else it's a waste. (because
you only have a few precious easy key spots, yet you have one hundred
commands in common use.)

In GNU Emacs's default keybinding, there are many such wastes. For
example, all 【Ctrl+‹number›】 and 【Alt+‹number›】 are bound
to digit-argument. The digit-argument is a non-repeat command, yet it
sits on 20 EASY repeatable keys. (but most damaging is that
digit-argument isn't a frequently needed command, with respect to all
commands and the relatively few easy-key-spots.)

Another bad example is forward-page 【Ctrl+x ]】. forward-page is a
repeatable command, but it doesn't have a repeating key. Imagine, if
every time you need to ⇟ Page ▽ that you have to press 【Ctrl+x】
first. You couldn't just hold it down.

But remember, this “Repeatable and Non-Repeatable key” is only a
supporting criterion in keybinding design. It is not the most important
criterion. The single most important criterion in designing a keyboard
shortcut system is that most frequently used commands be mapped to the
most easy-to-press keys.

1.4.3 Ergoemacs Key Chord Reduction

File: ergoemacs-mode.info,  Node: [Control+x] and [Control-c] reduction,  Next: Movement without key-chords,  Up: Ergoemacs Key Chord Reduction

1.4.3.1 [Control+x] and [Control-c] reduction
.............................................

For emacs, the most common prefixes are [Control-x] or [Control-c].

For QWERTY, an additional mapping of these keys have been made: - A
modified Control-x map has been assigned to Menu f: - This map allows
you to type the keys without a key chord requirement. For example to
switch buffers instead of [Control+x] [b] you could type [Menu] [f]
[b]. (Note that the [f] key changes based on layout; For example using
the colemak layout you would type [Menu] [t] [b] to switch buffers).

   * This modified keymap changes the control-chorded keys to
     alt-chorded keys since they are easier to reach, there is another
     keymap that removes the control-chorded keys. Therefore to get the
     buffer list, instead of having to type [Control-x] [Control-b] you
     can type [Menu] [f] [Alt-b].

   * The [Alt-] keychords in this modified keymap are changed to
     [Control-] keys. For example, `repeat-complex-command' is mapped
     from [Control-x] [Alt+:] to [Menu] [f] [Control-:]. As far as I
     can tell this is the only [Control-x] [Alt] combination.

   * A modified unchorded Control-x map has assigned to QWERTY [Menu]
     [r]. This map has changed the Control-x map as follows:

   * Chorded control keys are subset. Therefore only keys that have the
     combination [Control-x] [Control-] are used.

   * Chorded key combinations are changed drop the chord. For example
     the buffer list [Control-x] [Conrtol-b] is changed to [Menu] [r]
     [b].

   * Chorded key combinations that are single key are translated to
     [Alt+] for example [Control+k] [a] is changed to [Menu] [r] [k]
     [Alt+a]

   * Chorded key combinations that work with [Alt+] are translated to
     [Control+]. For example [Control+k] [Alt+a] is changed to [Menu]
     [r] [k] [Control+a]. I don't think there are currently any keys
     bound to these types of key combinations. They are quite difficult
     to press and remember.


Similarly The Control-c keymap is rebound to [Menu] [j] for the
modified [Control-c] keymap and [Menu] [u] for the unchorded
[Control-c] keymap. This is also true of the [Control-h] keymap. This
is bound to [Menu] [h] for the normal Control-h keymap. It is also
bound to [Menu] [y] for the unchorded Control-h keymap.


File: ergoemacs-mode.info,  Node: Movement without key-chords,  Prev: [Control+x] and [Control-c] reduction,  Up: Ergoemacs Key Chord Reduction

1.4.3.2 Movement without key-chords
...................................

One can enable movement without key-chords as follows: - On QWERTY,
press [Menu] [k] and then the movement key. This key is repeatable.
Therefore [Menu] [k] [k] [k] would move the cursor down two lines. If
this is followed by [i] this would have the cursor move up a line. To
exit the repeatable movement/delete keys press [Menu]. This is similar
to VIM's edit mode, with a toggle of the [Menu] key. - Shifted keys
still are allowed. For example, page up can be accomplished in QWERTY
by [Shift+i]. - Any command that enters the minibuffer also exits the
repeatable movement/deletion. - Any undefined key in the keymap (like
1) would exit the mode and insert the character - To reduce the shifted
key-chords, on QWERTY you can also press [Menu] [i]. Therefore [Menu]
[i] [i] is equivalent to one page up. Followed by a [k] will be the
page-down equivalent - Again, [Menu] stops the movement mode and
anything that enters the minibuffer removes the movement mode. - Any
undefined key in the keymap (like 1) would exit the mode and insert the
character - Shift and the key is the unshifted command. Therefore
[Menu] [i] [i] [Shift+k] would be Page Up followed by down one
character. ## Layouts Supported ## Tips for adopting ErgoEmacs
Keybindings If you are a long time emacs user, you may find it painful
to adopt this setup.

This difficulty is nothing special. It's the same difficulty when you
switching to dvorak after years of qwerty. Basically, it's about
changing muscle memory.

1.4.4 Where Did My Command Go?
------------------------------

The ergonomic-mode minor mode features the command
where-is-old-binding, with shortcut “Ctrl+h o”. This command asks
you to type a shortcut, and tells you which command it was bound in GNU
Emacs, and the new shortcut for it under ErgoEmacs?.


File: ergoemacs-mode.info,  Node: Shortcut To Open Cheatsheet,  Prev: Where Did My Command Go?,  Up: Banish Key Chords

1.4.5 Shortcut To Open Cheatsheet
---------------------------------

You can open a cheatsheet by pressing [Control+h] [']. On the first
run, this will create a svg and (possibly) create a png based on the
svg (if `ergoemacs-inkscape' points to the inkscape executable). Once
these are created, the cheatsheet will be opened displaying all the
keys based on your layout. ### Gradual Adoption for an Emacs User
Here's some tips that may help you adopt. #### Level 1 If you find it
too painful to switch, don't use the whole package. Instead, start off
with just the arrow key movements.

(setq ergoemacs-variant "lvl1") (ergoemacs-mode 1)

Either put the above in your emacs init file (usually at
“~/.emacs”), or customize ergoemacs-mode to set the variant to lvl1.

With only the above change, you will increase your emacs productivity,
especially if you are a touch typist. These single char cursor moving
commands are the top 4 most frequently used emacs commands by
statistics, roughly accounting for 43% of commands that have a shortcut.

Once you used the above for a couple of weeks, you may add more keys to
adopt.

1.5.1 Globally defined keys
---------------------------

These keys are defined on the global keymap and should be retained
regardless of the variant or layout used. However, these keys will not
show up on keyboard documentation generated by ergoemacs. Additionally,
these keys may be masked or remapped by other programs. ### Ergoemacs
defined keys These keys are defined in the ergoemacs-keymap. When the
layout changes by changing options, these keys are lost. However, you
may create your own variant to allow these keys to be saved. ####
Adding a ergonomic key Ergonomic keys can be added by:

(ergoemacs-key "M-a" 'execute-extended-command "Execute")

This adds the Alt-a command to all keyboards based on the QWERTY
layout. This only applies to the currently selected keyboard variant.

Note the last parameter is optional and allows Ergoemacs to document
that this is an "Execute" command when generating keyboard layout
diagrams. #### Adding a fixed key Fixed keys can be added by:

(ergoemacs-fixed-key "C-o" 'ido-find-file "Open File")

This adds the fixed key to the currently selected emacs variant

Note the last parameter is optional and allows Ergoemacs to document
that this is an "Open" command when generating keyboard layout diagrams.

This lists the keyboard positions from left to right for the unshifted
and shifted states of he keyboard. After listing the keyboard
descriptions it provides a description of the layout which is used for
the customization variable `ergoemacs-keyboard-layout'. By simply
defining your layout before ergoemacs-mode is loaded, you add it to the
ergoemacs-keyboard-layout variable with its description. ###
Customizing/Saving the variables You can customize the ergoemacs

To generate keyboard binding diagrams and scripts that allow you to use
ergoemacs elsewhere, please type M-x ergoemacs-extra. These scripts
will be stored under the extras directory.

Note that if you use an alternative layout on a QWERTY keyboard (such
as colemak), and use the portable colemak layout, to use ergoemacs keys
use the us layout not the colemak layout. However, if you installed the
colemak keyboard layout to your system, use the colemak not the US

To tell if a key was a globally defined emacs key, ergoemacs needs to
know what key was defined by emacs. This typically changes a little for
each emacs version. This is due to renamed functions, or re-purposed
keys. To update for the current version of emacs, you can type

(ergoemacs-warn-globally-changed-keys t)

This is also done in the test suite. This can be accessed by
`ergoemacs-test' command.
